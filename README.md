# G.L.E.A. (Gotta *List* 'Em All)


GLEA is a demo Pokedex application which lists (üòè) and shows Pokemon details, such as type and stats, whenever the user selects one. The app has been designed using **Clean Architecture** and **MVI**.

GLEA uses the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) for retrieving pokemon details that are updated in the database, allowing offline use once the database has been populated
